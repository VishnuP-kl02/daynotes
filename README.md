Project  Mangement -  Jira

SDLC lifecycle

1.Requirement Gathering
2.Analysing the requirements  
3. Designing
4. Development phase
5.Testing
6.Deployement
7.Maintainence

AGILE methodology - Product Owner, (Dev and Quality Analysis) - Scrum, Scrum Master

P.O - Features of User in Agile - User Story. All user story combined and its gives Epic. If the product is delayed the product backlog. These are done by P.O. 

SM - covers backlog, covers features with Dev & QA, Assigns tasks. Name is given as Sprint for certain backlog of 2 weeks.

Zephyr and Power BI test manger for JIRA.

In JIRA we cannot add testcases, we need to use plugins like Zephyr to add testcases.
These are like plugins which are added upon.

Day 3 notes

Neural network concepts - 

Perceptron - ANN
Sum(F) = x1*w1+x2*w2+x3*w3+…

They extract identifying features from data, lacking pre-programmed understanding. Network components include neurons, connections, weights, biases, propagation function etc.

There are several computing units which are acted upon. But whereas in GPU these are computed parallel, thus making computation faster.

In 2005 - image-net, data set of several images.
AGI - Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is a field of theoretical AI research that attempts to create software with human-like intelligence and the ability to self-teach. The aim is for the software to be able to perform tasks that it is not necessarily trained or developed for. 

Limitation - Data reading might not be correct as exactly analyzed.

Applications :- Travel, Heath-care, Sales, Marketing, Social Media, Automation, Credit & Insurance

Machine Learning consists of Supervised and Unsupervised learning.

Supervised has Classification and Regression. - It requires guidance and labels should be given.
Unsupervised has Clustering and Association. - It doesn’t guidance and no labels required.

Python:

a.Object oriented
b.High level
c.Interpreted

Libraries in Python

NumPy is  a python library for large multi dimensional array processing.
Pandas - for characters, strings etc
Scikit learn - machine learning library

Mode, Mean, Median - Central Tendency			 Percentile

Descriptive Statistics : Descriptive statistics are tabular, graphical, and numerical summaries of data. The purpose of descriptive statistics is to facilitate the presentation and interpretation of data.  It include Tabular, Graphical and Numerical methods.

Distribution curve, Bell curve

Percentile : Upto a certain limit where it is used

Range - Spread if Distribution		R = Large - Small
Standard Deviation :  measure of how spread out numbers are.
  

When SD = 0 the graph of the distribution curve will be a straight line 

Variance = sq of Standard Deviation
. 

Qualifier

Q1 - 25th percentile					LB = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
Q2 - 50th percentile (Median)
Q3 - 75th percentile					UB = Q3 - 1.5 * IQR

IQR - Inter Quartile Range = Q3 - Q1

Box plots are useful as they provide a visual summary of the data enabling researchers to quickly identify mean values, the dispersion of the data set, and signs of skewness.


Co-relation coefficient :- A correlation coefficient is a number between -1 and 1 that tells you the strength and direction of a relationship between variables.

Types - Pearson coefficient, Sphearman coefficient.

Histogram

Cumulative Distribution function (CDF)

While plotting we can represent as Probablity density function (pdf) and Cumulative density function (cdf)

ZScore :  z =  (x - mu)/sigma        mu- avg, sigma - SD 

Scatter Plot - Bivariate analysis

Confidence Interval : The confidence interval is the range of values that you expect your estimate to fall between a certain percentage of the time 
 For example, if you construct a confidence interval with a 95% confidence level, you are confident that 95 out of 100 times the estimate will fall between the upper and lower values specified by the confidence interval.

Probablity

Gaussian Distribution, Normal Distribution-- Special case of Gaussian

Normal Distribution = Zero mean
In Maths there are mostly reversible transformations only.

Sampling and Population

Central Limit Theorem - The central limit theorem states that the sampling distribution of a sample mean is approximately normal if the sample size is large enough, even if the population distribution is not normal.

Significance level

P value -  calculated as a difference between two probablities.
Paired test -- Null Hypotheis

Null Hypothesis & Alternate Hypothesis : 

Null hypothesis (H0): there is no difference in longevity between the two groups.
Alternative hypothesis (HA or H1): there is a difference in longevity between the two groups.

C-Statistic - ROC curve: 



The z-score for the sampling distribution of the sample means is

where μμ is the mean of the population the sample is taken from, σσ is the standard deviation of the population the sample is taken from, and nn is the sample size.
